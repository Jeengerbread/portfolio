	1.	Summarize the distinction(s) from the traditional Klines + Clines definition of the cyborg vs. the one that Clark is proposing as the main thesis of his book?
	<br>
	The word cyborb that Clynes and Kline coined was and acronym of Cybernetic Organism or Cybernetically Controlled Organism. They proposed a self-regulating system that could merge with an organism and provide some functions that required no conscious effort on the organism’s part. During this time it was believed that drugs could be used to imbue organisms with all sorts of abilities. Clark builds on this definition, narrowing down what could be considered a cyborg, calling the first real cyborgs, a lab rat and a cat named Lolo, “disappointing.” Clark proposes that a real cyborg be a more complete merger between organism and computer, instead of the symbiotic relationship shown in the 1960s. Clark’s cyborg demands a deeper integration such that “we feel no boundary between ourselves and the nonbiological elements.
